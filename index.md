Welcome to my blog.

I'm a data scientist working at the intersection of computer science, molecular biology, and information systems.

I plan to blog about technology, hardware/software performance, and computational biology/data science related topics.

I have advanced degrees in Computer Science and consider myself very technical.

However I am not a professional hardware evaluator/benchmark designer.
So most of my opinions are from an enthusiast's point of view; from someone who loves technology and uses it everyday for both work and recreation.

I'm generally not a purist about most things technical, but I do rant about personal pet peeves from time to time.
Also, any opinion expressed here is that of my own solely and does not represent the company I work for, my previous academic colleagues, or collaborators.
