## Dell G16 7360 Optimization Phase 2

In a previous post I described my purchase and initial optimization of the Dell G16 7360 (2023) laptop in terms of cooling and clock speed.

A key thing to note, the main heat culprit is the Intel Raptor Lake CPU, while the Nvidia RTX 4070 GPU appears to be reasonably cooled on even 
GPU intense applications, though this remains to be tested with more demanding ones.

I've been running a CPU and GPU intensive application as a test/benchmark to evaluate the various cooling and clock speeds mentioned in the previous post.
While the utilities in that post definitely gave me control over both the fan and clock speeds, I found that I still needed an extra edge in cooling
for performance intensive applications, especially those that would peg the CPU.

In this post I'll describe briefly what should hopefully be the final step in the process, the purchase of a IETS GT500 active cooling pad.

I had seen this recommended on reddit (of course) and read the reviews on Amazon, which were almost entirely positive, sans the complaints over the noise the
5000 RPM fan makes.

My own experience more or less confirms those claims.  Even after a fairly extended session of the CPU-intensive application I was using as an informal benchmark, I found the bottom to be ice cold and the laptop as a whole to be only warm to the touch.
The processors here, being the most important were generally < 90 degrees celcius and more like low 80's to high 70's on average, so limited thermal throttling.
The GPU stayed under 80.

This is with the CPU's clock uncapped to allow it to reach maximum (5.4Ghz) speeds but still only using the 8 P cores with the other 16 E cores turned "off" in the BIOS.
Also, I had the AWCC profile set to custom with 100% CPU and GPU fans.

While CPU thermal throttling still ocurrs occassionaly according to HWiNFO64, it appears these are rare, spikes in the session, with averages well below the thermal throttling threshold.
