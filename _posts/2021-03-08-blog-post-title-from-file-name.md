## First Entry

Roughly 16 years after blogging became popular (2008), and some years after it fell out of vogue, I'm actually starting my blog!

A couple of my reasons to blog now.

  1. I have some time
  2. I have some topics to write about (gaming laptops, large scale computing, performance engineering...)
  3. I've been meaning to do this for *years*

So hold onto your hats (if you wear them) and watch me *not* update this for the next several months ;)
